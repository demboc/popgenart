## Tutorial

popgenART comes with two sample csv files to be used as sample inputs. One csv file (sample_input.csv) contains parameters with pre-assigned values and, thus, can be used to run the line of code below.

```
./popgenART.sh -i sample_input.csv -p <prefix> -f <location of fastsimcoal2 binary> -a <location of art_illumina binary>
```
*Note: ./popgenART.sh can be replaced with the location of the wrapper script. All flags are required.
