Run this:
./wrapper_script.sh -i sampleinput.par -p trial -f <location of your fastsimcoal binary>


Make sure that you have
1. fsc
2. rbase (for this, edit the script if you are not running in the pgc hpc server -> change to whatever can run an r script)
3. add execution permission to the other .sh files (if di pa ok)
