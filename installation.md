## Installation 

Installation of popgenART can be done in three ways as will be outlined below. Upon installation of the dependencies, the user can opt to use a wrapper script run using bash or implemented in Snakemake. The user may also opt to forgo the installation of the dependencies by pulling a docker image containing the scripts and required programs. 

### Bash
To run the pipeline fully in Bash, install the following dependencies:
1. FastSimCoal2 (https://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal28/
2. ART_Illumina (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art)
